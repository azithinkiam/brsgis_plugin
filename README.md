versioning - please disregard the # of commits...i'm sure there's a better way, but it's too late
to bother with that tonight.  at least it looks clean from the top-level now.

v1.99 (PRD) || 2019.05.05 00:40
--------
This is the inital production release of the "final" v1 deliverable.  It is likely that there 
will be minor tweaks required during early adoption.  Potential issues include lack of error-handling 
(to be addressed in v2), confusion over 'clientName' and 'folderName' and exactly how to input
the names they want to print on the labels/yellowSheet/mapTable, etc.

SIGNIFICANT UPDATES in this release include:

Optimized "relatedWork" process to generate 'old_plan' relationships for JOBS and ABUTTERS

Created/Enabled SQL table/triggers

Updated UI forms (contacts, jobs, plans)

Updated UI form code (contacts, jobs, plans)

LEGACY PLANS have been imported - all outstanding plans require review.

I'll continue to track reported issues in GitHub and will reference them here.
